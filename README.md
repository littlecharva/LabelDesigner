# LabelDesigner

LabelDesigner for use with the CrunchLabs HackPack 003 Label Maker.  Allows you to draw text, rectangles, ellipses, lines and Bezier curves to a webpage and manipulate those elements until you're happy with the layout before printing it to the Label Maker.

It requires you to replace the existing Arduino Nano with an Arduino Nano ESP32.  The code can be opened in VSCode and compiled and uploaded using PlatformIO.
